## 2.3.1

### ðŸŽ¯ Improved Developer Experience

- **Concise Mixin Name**: Renamed `DireDiConvenienceMixin` to simply `DI` for better readability
- **Cleaner Syntax**: Use `with DireDiMixin, DI` instead of the longer mixin name
- **Better Documentation**: Updated all examples and error messages to use the shorter name

## 2.3.0

### ðŸŽ‰ New Flutter Integration

- **DireDiMixin**: New mixin for easy Flutter StatefulWidget integration
- **Automatic Container Management**: No need to manually create DireContainer instances
- **Sync and Async API**: `get<T>()` for immediate access, `getAsync<T>()` for auto-initialization
- **Global Container**: Single container instance shared across all widgets
- **Type Safety**: Full generic type support with compile-time checking
- **Flutter Optimized**: Designed specifically for StatefulWidget states

### ï¿½ Auto-Generated Convenience Properties

- **DI Mixin**: Auto-generated mixin with direct property access
- **Zero Boilerplate**: Direct `userService` access instead of `get<UserService>()`
- **IDE Integration**: Full auto-completion and refactoring support
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking for all generated properties
- **Async Variants**: Both `userService` and `userServiceAsync` for each component
- **Clean UI Code**: Eliminates DI syntax completely from widget code

### ï¿½ðŸ“± Flutter Developer Experience

- **Zero Boilerplate**: Add `with DireDiMixin, DI` and access dependencies directly
- **Convenient Methods**: `has<T>()`, `getAll<T>()`, `register<T>()`, `hasAsync<T>()`
- **Qualifier Support**: Named instances via `get<T>('name')` and `getAsync<T>('name')`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of uninitialized containers
- **Testing Support**: `DireDiMixin.reset()` for test isolation

## 2.2.0

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Features

- **Consolidated Code Generation**: New `@DireDiEntryPoint` annotation allows consolidating all DI registrations into a single file
- **Multi-File Support**: Components can now be spread across multiple files and automatically discovered
- **Single Registration Call**: `registerGeneratedDependencies()` only needs to be called once from the entry point
- **Aggregating Builder**: New builder scans entire project and generates consolidated registration code
- **Improved Developer Experience**: No more managing multiple `.dire_di.dart` files

### ðŸš€ Mobile Platform Support

- **Mirrors-Free by Default**: Main `dire_di_generator` is now mirrors-free and mobile compatible
- **Flutter/Android/iOS Compatible**: Generated code runs on all Flutter platforms without restrictions
- **Build-Time Only Dependencies**: Code analysis happens only during build, not at runtime
- **Single Builder**: Eliminated builder conflicts - only one active builder by default

### ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

- **Renamed Builders**: Main builder is now `dire_di_generator` (was `di_mirrors_free_generator`)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Fixed "Potential outputs must be unique" error by making legacy builders opt-in only
- Added `MirrorsFreeAggregatingBuilder` for mobile platform compatibility
- Enhanced import path resolution for better generated code
- Improved dependency ordering in generated registrations
- Better error handling and logging during code generation

### ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes

- **Builder Names**: Main builder renamed from `di_mirrors_free_generator` to `dire_di_generator`
- **Auto-Apply**: Legacy `di_generator` is now opt-in only (`auto_apply: none`)
- **Default Behavior**: Package now uses mirrors-free generation by default

### ðŸ“š Documentation

- Updated examples to demonstrate multi-file usage
- Added comprehensive documentation for `@DireDiEntryPoint`
- Improved README with new usage patterns
- Added explanation of mirrors-free approach for mobile platforms
- Added explanation of mirrors-free approach for mobile platforms

### ðŸš€ Migration Guide

**Before (multiple files):**

```dart
// Each file had its own .dire_di.dart
import 'service1.dire_di.dart';
import 'service2.dire_di.dart';

container.registerGeneratedDependencies(); // Multiple calls needed
```

**After (consolidated):**

```dart
@DireDiEntryPoint()
class AppModule {}

import 'app_module.dire_di.dart';
container.registerGeneratedDependencies(); // Single call!
```

### ðŸ“± Mobile Platform Notes

This package now fully supports Android/iOS through mirrors-free code generation. The `dart:mirrors` dependency only exists during build time for legacy builders. The default `di_mirrors_free_generator` produces code that runs without any mirrors dependency on mobile platforms.
